# soldering

if you have never soldered before, i recommend looking at [this little instructional cartoon](https://blog.adafruit.com/2010/02/19/soldering-is-easy-heres-how-to-do-it-comic/)

say hello to your PCB
![](pics/step01.png)

first solder the resistors. they are all 10k ohm. they have no polarity, but try to align them all the same way. just pick one. it makes it easier to see what is going on for other people (or yourself in a couple of weeeks)
![](pics/step02.png)

solder the 16mhz chrystal. the crystal has no polarity
![](pics/step03.png)

solder the 18pf capacitors. they have no polarity
![](pics/step04.png)

solder the 100uf capacitors. again no polarity here
![](pics/step05.png)

solder the IC sockets. NB: make sure to orient them correctly
![](pics/step06.png)

solder the programmer pin headers
![](pics/step07.png)

solder the power connector. for this workshop we will use 2 rows of ordinary male pin headers. to make sure they fit your eurorack power cable, connect the pin headers to the power cable while soldering them. this way they are correctly aligned

![](pics/step08B.png)

to route the potentiometers 3 pins to the atmega328, apply solder to the 3 solder bridges marked POT1, POT2, and POT3
![](pics/step09A.png)
![](pics/step09B.png)

solder the angled pin headers to the back of the PCB. NB: careful with the orientation: if you solder the pin headers to the top of the PCB your module will not fit in your synthesizer!
![](pics/step10.png)

mount the ICs in the IC sockets. NB: mind the orientation of the chips, and be careful not to mix up the DAC and the opamp

that's it! you're done :) now we need to add a faceplate and program it

# faceplate

now it gets interesting! you have to decide on how many plugs your module needs. if in doubt, i suggest 3 plugs.

mark on the PCB where you want to position the plugs and drill holes :) NB: make sure you can fit the plugs and the electronics on the backside, when you solder faceplate and mainboard together. see pics below for suggested placement:

![](pics/faceplateSuggestedPlugPlacement.png)

![](pics/drill.png)

once you have the plugs mounted on the faceplate it's time to solder the potentiometers.

when connecting the faceplate to the mainboard be sure everything is aligned in a perfect 90 degree angle: solder one or two pins and calibrate before soldering all the pins. NB: if things are not straight, you module might not fit in inside your synthesizer!

connect the ground pins of the audio jacks together. you can use wire, but might as well use some of the cut off legs from used components that you have floating around your work desk by now. 

then wire the jacks to GND on the mainboard.

![](pics/connectGND.png)

GND from the jacks to GND on the mainboard (could be anywhere, but see suggested connector on pic), and connect AMP1 to tip connector of the audio / CV out jack (see pic).

![](pics/AMP1toJack.png)

now attach knobs to your potentiometers, and hey: well done! you've assembled your first module :)

once the module is assembled, we need to upload testcode to the chip to see if everything works. go to the [code](https://github.com/jsr606/EUROPROTO/tree/master/SoundDays_MPlab/code) part of this repository to find code examples and guidelines

# technical notes

a simulation of the op amp circuit can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/y3vhav76

# expansion possibilities

the following is small schematics for possible expansions, giving your module more capabilities

## CV in

use the following schematic to scale voltages from -10V to 10V to an atmega safe 0 to 5V
